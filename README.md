### App list
> Update: Locket Gold now require config to be toggled while using. If you are lazy, just put revenuecat domain in Adguard DNS filter (block both subdomain and path). Make sure to use external config (put it inside a txt file and host it somewhere), in-app settings doesn't work.
- Adguard
- <del>Adblock for Youtube</del> <del><i>(video loading is quite slow, just sideload uYou instead)</i></del> <i>(uYou is abandoned, build YTLite instead)</i>
- Locket <i>(Doesn't get you Gold badge anymore but other Gold features still doing fine)</i>
- PicsArt <i>(require config to be toggled while using)</i>
- Truecaller <i>(barely work anymore, you only get a **fake** Premium status)</i>
- <del>Soundcloud</del> <i>(only unlocking premium app icons, that's all)</i>, <ins><i>(plus it doesn't work anymore)</i></ins>
- VPN - Super Unlimited Proxy <i>(somewhat broken, you need to toggle config before opening the app)</i>
- <del>Lot of outdated and broken configs from <b><i>NobyDa</i></b> and <b><i>langkhach270389</i></b></del>
